Type: Directory

User groups define the rights (policies) granted to the group members. The built-in groups `read`, `write` and `full` cannot be removed. See [User](../../guides/authentication-authorization-accounting/user.md) for the full guide.

**Arguments**

- `name` (string): Group name.
- `policy` (multi { array-id, array-id, policy: super { ! , policy: enum } }): Rights granted to group members. Prefix a policy with `!` to revoke it. `add` revokes every policy it does not list, and a new group created without `policy` gets every policy negated (no rights). `set` changes only the policies it lists: `set policy=read,rest-api` on a group with `api` keeps `api`; `policy=!api` revokes it. Default: none.
  - `local` - Log in on the local console.
  - `telnet` - Log in through Telnet.
  - `ssh` - Log in through SSH.
  - `ftp` - Log in through FTP; allows reading, writing and erasing files (use together with `read` and `write`).
  - `reboot` - Reboot the router.
  - `read` - Read access to the router configuration.
  - `write` - Write access to the configuration except user management; does not include `read`.
  - `policy` - User management rights (use together with `write`); also allows seeing script variables created by other users (requires `test`) and designing WebFig skins (requires `sensitive`).
  - `test` - Run ping, traceroute, bandwidth-test, wireless scan and snooper, fetch, email and other test tools.
  - `winbox` - Log in through WinBox and use bandwidth-test authentication.
  - `password` - Change the user's own password with `/password`.
  - `web` - Log in through WebFig.
  - `sniff` - Use the packet sniffer, torch and traffic generator.
  - `sensitive` - See and change sensitive information.
  - `api` - Access the router through the API.
  - `romon` - Connect to the RoMON server.
  - `rest-api` - Access the router through the REST API.
- `skin` (enum): WebFig skin applied to group members logging in through WebFig. Default: default.
