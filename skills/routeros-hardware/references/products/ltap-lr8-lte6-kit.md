## Configuration

We recommend clicking the "Check for updates" button and updating your RouterOS software to the latest version to ensure the best performance and stability. RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting here to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: <https://mt.lv/help> In case IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool (<https://mt.lv/winbox>) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from a network, see the section (link) section part 4;- Please see the picture below for reference on how to place rubber seals for best water protection;

- Reassembly in backorder. Tightening torque for PCB screws 0.3 Nm, case cover/enclosure screws 0.5 Nm.

After you have reinserted the device into the case and secured it with the screws that were removed earlier, slide in the SIM cards from your mobile operator into the SIM slots, with the chips facing as shown on the port label. The slot accepts miniSIM (2FF). SIM slots 2 and 3 apply to the bottom miniPCIe slot and can be switched in RouterOS "/system routerboard sim" menu.

## Reset button
