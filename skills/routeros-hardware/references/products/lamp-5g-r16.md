## [LAMP 5G R16](https://mikrotik.com/product/lamp_5g_r16) (LAMPGM&RG520F-EU)

A rugged outdoor 5G device that uses omnidirectional antennas and built-in eSIM support to automatically connect to the best available tower – no antenna alignment or physical SIM swaps required. IP67, maritime durability, GNSS, PoE-in. See the [LAMP 5G R16 product page](https://mikrotik.com/product/lamp_5g_r16) for full specifications and brochures.

## Quickstart

- Open the Ethernet port door;
- Insert a SIM card into the slot as indicated on the device;
- Connect the device to the included PoE injector with an Ethernet cable to the data+power end;
- Connect the data end of the PoE injector to the computer;
- Connect the power adapter to the PoE injector;
- Configure your device using a web browser through WebFig or the WinBox tool at <https://mt.lv/WinBox>; multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;
- Access WebFig by opening <https://192.168.188.1>, and for WinBox, download the tool, navigate to the Neighbors tab, and select the MAC address. The username is "admin" with no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- select the "Check for updates" button and update RouterOS to the latest version. Must have a valid SIM card inserted and active Internet connection;
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the WebFig or WinBox "Files" menu and reboot the device;
- By upgrading your RouterOS software to the latest version, you can ensure optimal performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

## Powering

- Number of DC inputs: 1 (PoE-IN).
- PoE in: 802.3 af/at.
- PoE in input Voltage: 12-56 V.
- Power adapter rated current: 0.5 A.
- Maximum power consumption without accessories: 10 W.
- Maximum power consumption: 10 W.

## Mounting

- Slide the included metallic mounting rings into the two slots on the back of the antenna dish.
- Attach the unit to a pole, with the Ethernet port pointing downward.
- Use a PH2 screwdriver to tighten the rings.
- Fix the Ethernet cable to the pole using zip ties, less than one meter from the unit, to avoid the cable being pulled out of the port. To use a patched Ethernet cable, the rubber seal must first be cut. Alternatively, insert the cable through the rubber seal before attaching the RJ45 connector.
- Do not use a cable without the rubber seal, as this will compromise the IP67 rating.
- Check mounting angle and positioning.
- When mounting outdoors, ensure that any cable openings are directed downwards. Use a PoE injector and proper grounding, this device has a specially-designed grounding connector under the port cover. Recommended using shielded Cat5/6 cable. The IP rating scale for this device is IP67.

## Configuration

Configuration can be done using a web browser through WebFig, the WinBox tool <https://mt.lv/winbox> methods are available to ensure accessibility.

- To access WebFig, open <https://192.168.188.1> in your browser.
- For WinBox, download the tool, go to the Neighbors tab, and select the MAC address. The default username is "admin", **find the password on the device sticker**.
- You should check for updates frequently to ensure your RouterOS software remains up to date for the best performance and stability. select the "Check for updates" button in WinBox or WebFig to update to the latest version.

A valid SIM card must be inserted or an eSIM set up, along with an active Internet connection, for updates to work.

RouterOS provides a wide range of configuration options beyond what's described in this document. We suggest visiting <https://mt.lv/help> explore these features.

For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device for reinstallation, see section .

## eSIM settings

By default the device is configured to use the SIM slot. To use the on-board eSIM, switch the slot by using the following command: **`/interface/lte/settings/set sim-slot=esim`**

A single eSIM chip can store multiple eSIM profiles, the maximum profile count depends on the eSIM chip used.

See the [LTE eSIM](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/mobile-networking/lte-5g#lte-esim) page for details.

## Reset button

The reset button has three functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until the green LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration (total 5 seconds).
- Keep holding for 5 more seconds, LED turns solid, release now to turn on CAP mode. The device will now look for a CAPsMAN server (total of 10 seconds).
- Reinstall RouterOS using Netinstall. To reinstall RouterOS using the Netinstall utility, enter the device into BOOTP mode. There are two types of booters available: the regular booter and the backup booter. Regular booter - Power on the device, wait 1-2 seconds, then press and hold the Reset button. Wait until the "USR" LED is blinking, then turns solid "On". When the "USR" LED turns "Off", release the Reset button - the device will enter BOOTP mode.
- Backup booter – Power off the device, press and hold the Reset button, then power it on. Wait until the "USR" LED is blinking, then turns solid "On". When the "USR" LED turns "Off", release the Reset button - the device will enter BOOTP mode using the backup booter.

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

Netinstall: When performing Netinstall, make sure to use the latest v7 version of both ROS files and the Netinstall software.

## Grounding

The device includes a grounding connection (marked ⏚) which you should connect to the grounding installation of the tower or building where the device will be used. This is to substantially reduce the risk of ESD and lightning damage.

## Accessories

The package includes the following accessories that come with the device:

- 24 V 0.5 A power adapter
- LAMP mount
- Gigabit PoE injector
