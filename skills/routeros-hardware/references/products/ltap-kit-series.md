## Configuration

You should select the "Check for updates" button and update your RouterOS software to the latest version to ensure the best performance and stability. RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting here to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: <https://mt.lv/help> In case IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool (<https://mt.lv/winbox>) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from a network, see the section .

## GPS

The built-in GPS module requires an external antenna to be used (SMA connector is already mounted behind the unit door). See the section on how to remove the door.
**Attention** the GPS uses an active antenna, only connect and disconnect the antenna, when the device is turned off!

**Supports - GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo).**
Make sure that the GPS package is installed on your device. Check by following command /system package print. If not installed download extra packages at our download page accordingly to your RouterOS version and install the GPS package by dragging it to the Files menu. Enable GPS and start working:

- Enabling - /system gps set enable=yes;
- Setting antenna to external - /system gps set gps-antenna-select=external;
- Checking configuration - /system gps print.

## miniPCIe slot

### SIM card connectivity

- MiniPCIe 1 (top slot) supports PCIe and USB 2.0 cards but is shared with the USB 2.0 type A port (can use either the USB port or miniPCIe slot at the same time). It can be used only for SIM slot #1.
- MiniPCIe 2 (bottom slot) supports only USB (2.0 and 3.0) miniPCIe modems (no PCIe support). Uses SIM slot #2 and SIM slot #3. By default uses SIM slot #2.
- USB 2.0 type A port (can only be used if miniPCIe 1 is not used).
- To use the top miniPCIe slot with a USB type miniPCIe card, switch the USB connections to the miniPCIe slot: /system routerboard usb set type=mini-PCIe This will disable the USB 2.0 port on the front of the unit.
- Insert the SIM card into the top slot by a chip on the SIM card facing down. Bottom slots – with the chip facing up.
  check if you are using the correct SIM slot. For the modem inserted in the bottom mini-pcie slot, you need to use either sim slot 2 or sim slot 3. And the used sim slot needs to be selected in RouterOS.
  CLI command to select the sim slot: */system routerboard modem set sim-slot=2*

### Modem installation

This LtAP version is with the modem installed in the bottom slot. When installing an additional modem use the upper slot. In this case, an internal antenna is connected to the bottom modem.
Installing a miniPCIe module should be done by a qualified person, follow safety precautions when handling electrical equipment:

- Use a wrist grounding strap when unpacking and working with electrical components to avoid electrical discharge (ESD) damage;
- Remove six screws on the bottom of the case and lift off the top part of the case. Note that antenna cables are connected to the bottom modem;
- Locate the miniPCIe slot and remove two factory attached screws;
- Attach provided a thick thermal pad to the card, and install the card into miniPCIe slot so that thermal pad is between PCB and card;
- The secure card in place using previously removed two screws;
- Guide your antenna cables through openings near the GPS connector and connect to your modem. Recommended using silicone rubber to secure connectors in place.
- Attach a thinner thermal pad to the top of the card;
- When using external antennas, connectors can be attached on the case sides, to make openings use a 6.5 mm drill bit, see section part 4;
