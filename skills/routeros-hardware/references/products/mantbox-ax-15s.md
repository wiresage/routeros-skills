## Configuration

We recommend clicking the "Check for updates" button and updating your RouterOS software to the latest version to ensure the best performance and stability. RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest visiting the RouterOS documentation page to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: <https://mt.lv/help> In case an IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool (<https://mt.lv/winbox>) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the internet port by default).

## Mounting

The mANTbox 12s and 15s come with a QuickMount adapter that can be attached to a wall using the included screws, or attached to a pole, using the included metal mounting ring. The QuickMount allows the device to be adjusted horizontally and vertically.

- Please avoid connecting a loose Ethernet cable to the Ethernet port, secure the cable to a wall or the pole, so that the cable weight is not pulling the port. It is recommended to secure the Ethernet cable less than 2m from the device. This is to ensure that the cable doesn't damage the port by its weight, or doesn't fall out.
  We recommend using Cat6 shielded cables.
  Warning! This equipment should be installed and operated with a minimum distance of 25 cm between the device and your body. The operation of this equipment in the residential environment could cause radio interference.

Please avoid connecting a loose Ethernet cable to the Ethernet port, secure the cable to a wall or the pole, so that the cable weight is not pulling the port. It is recommended to secure the Ethernet cable less than 2m from the device. This is to ensure that the cable doesn't damage the port by its weight, or doesn't fall out. It is possible to connect a grounding wire to the device, by opening the lid, a grounding screw is provided there.

## Grounding

The installation infrastructure (towers and masts), as well as the router itself, must be properly grounded. The device includes a grounding wire attachment screw behind the case door. Attach your grounding wire to the grounding screw, then attach the other end of the grounding wire to the grounded mast. This is to substantially reduce the risk of ESD and lightning damage.
