- Connect the power cord to the adapter, and then plug the power cord into a power outlet.

## Mounting

The device can be mounted in several ways: pole, wall, ceiling or it can be placed in a specially designed MikroTik holder which comes with the package. The package also includes a drill hole template with detailed mounting instructions, to help you with the Ethernet cable installation and attachment to a ceiling or a wall. Steel bracket to put on the other side of a dropdown ceiling tile and two screws and wall anchors. Zip ties or steel clamps for mounting on the pole.

The IP rating scale for this device is IP54. When mounting outdoors, please ensure that any cable openings are directed downwards. We recommend using the POE injector and proper grounding with Cat6 shielded cable. When using and installing this device please pay attention to Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) safety distance with a minimum of 20 cm between the radiator and your body.

Mounting on the mast or pole:

It's recommended to use electrical tape to increase friction between materials.

*[Figure]*

- Mount plastic tie straps to steel bracket guiding them through holes.
- Mount the bracket to the device.
- Secure them with a screw.
- Mount and align the device on the pole or mast.
- Guide the Ethernet cable through the opening and connect it to the Ethernet port.
- Close the bottom latch and secure it with a screw.

It's recommended to secure the Ethernet cable to the pole using zip ties. The distance from the device is approximately 30 cm.

Mounting unit on the wall:

*[Figure]*

- Use included a template to mark spots for drilling holes. And if needed for Ethernet cable. Align accordingly, it will depend on how the device will be mounted finally.
- Insert dowels if needed, depending on the wall structure and material.
- Place included a steel bracket on the wall.
- Use screws to secure it in place.
- Extend your Ethernet cable through the opening and connect to the Ethernet port.
- Mount the device on the steel bracket
- Secure it in place with the screw.
- Close the bottom latch.

Avoid mounting the device on the low ground spot, as you won't be able to attach and close the bottom latch.

Mounting on the ceiling:

*[Figure]*

A Special bracket is included in the package to mount on the drop ceiling. As it consists of two parts, to be attached on both sides of the ceiling tile.

- Use the template to mark spots for holes.
- Place both mounting brackets on the spot.
- Secure them together using screws.
- Continue assembling in the same manner if mounting on the wall.
- Extend your Ethernet cable through the opening and connect to the Ethernet port.
- Mount the device on the steel bracket.
- Secure it in place with the screw.
- Close the bottom latch.

## Bottom Lid

- The bottom lid is secured in place with the captive screw.

*[Figure]*

- Use a Torx T20 screwdriver to unscrew it, but do not remove the screw completely.

*[Figure]*

- Pull the cover in the opposite direction from the device to remove it.

  For more detailed information on LoRa settings, check the guide over here.

The configuration example, for both UDP and LNS scenarios with The Things Stack server, can be found here.

We recommend clicking the "Check for updates" button in the QuickSet menu, as updating your RouterOS software to the latest version ensures the best performance and stability. For wireless models, please make sure you have selected the country where the device will be used, to conform with local regulations.
RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting here to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: <https://mt.lv/help> In case IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool (<https://mt.lv/winbox>) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default).
For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device for reinstallation.

## MikroTik mobile app

Use the MikroTik smartphone app to configure your router in the field, or to apply the most basic initial settings for your MikroTik home access point.

*[Figure]*

- Scan the QR code and choose your preferred OS.
- Install and open the application.
- By default, the IP address and user name will be already entered.
- Click Connect to establish a connection to your device through a wireless network.
- Choose Quick setup and the application will guide you through all basic configuration settings in a couple of easy steps.
- An advanced menu is available to fully configure all necessary settings.

## Antenna usage

We recommend using an external antenna, which can be obtained separately, like our "LoRa omni antenna". The antenna has a pole mount and cable ready to use with LR cards - <https://mikrotik.com/product/868_omni_antenna>
The SMA connector located under the bottom door is already connected to the LR card and ready to be used. Please see the section on how to remove the door.

Please connect and disconnect the antenna, when the device is turned off!

**Internal antenna** 2 dBi can be used for setups where the distance to the gateway is closer than 1km. By default, the antenna is not connected to the card! To use an internal antenna:

- Open the bottom door (see "").

*[Figure]*

- Use the PH2 screwdriver to remove the screw.
- Disassemble the upper case from the bottom by sliding them to opposite sides.

*[Figure]*

- Locate the internal antenna cable and attach it to the LR card (connector labeled "RFIO"):

*[Figure]*

- The other connector (labeled "GPS"), is used for connecting GPS antennas.
- Reassembly.

## Buttons and jumpers

The reset button has three functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until the LED light starts flashing, and release the button to reset the RouterOS configuration (total 5 seconds).
- Keep holding for 5 more seconds, LED turns solid, release now to turn on CAP mode. The device will now look for a CAPsMAN server (total of 10 seconds).
- Or Keep holding the button for 5 more seconds until the LED turns off, then release it to make the RouterBOARD look for Netinstall servers (total 15 seconds).
  Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
