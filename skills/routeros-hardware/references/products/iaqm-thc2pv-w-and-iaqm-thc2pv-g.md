## Button controls

The device is operated with a single multi-function button located on the side. All menu navigation and settings are accessed through this button.

| Action | Where | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tap (50 ms – 3 s) | Main screen | Cycles to the next display layout |
| Hold (3 s) | Main screen | Opens the settings menu |
| Tap (50 ms – 1 s) | Settings menu | Cycles to the next menu option |
| Hold (1 s) | Settings menu | Confirms the highlighted menu item |
| No press (30 s inactivity) | Settings menu | Automatically reverts to the main screen |

### Settings menu

Hold (3 s) the button from the home screen to open the settings menu. The menu contains the following items:

- Pairing code
- Temperature unit
- VOC unit for Matter
- Unpairing
- CO₂ sensor calibration
- Display settings
- Back (exit)

Tap (50 ms – 1 s) cycles through the settings items; hold (1 s) to confirm an item. If no input is registered for 30 seconds, the screen automatically reverts to the main layout.

#### Pairing code

Navigate to **Pairing code** and hold (1 s). The screen displays the Matter QR pairing code. Hold (1 s), or wait for the 30-second timeout, to return to the main screen.

#### Temperature unit

Navigate to **Temperature unit** and hold (1 s). Choose Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), or Back. Hold (1 s) to save the unit and return to the main screen.

#### VOC unit for Matter

Navigate to **VOC unit for Matter** and hold (1 s). Choose ppm, µg/m³, or Back. Hold (1 s) to confirm and return to the main screen.

> **Note**
>
> The VOC unit can affect how the air quality data is displayed on different platforms. When using the **Google Home** app, use **ppm**. When using the **Apple HomePod** and **Amazon Alexa** apps, use **µg/m³**.

#### Unpairing

Navigate to **Unpairing** and hold (1 s); the screen will show "Ready to unpair BLE/Matter".

- If the 30-second timeout expires, the screen reverts back without unpairing.
- Tap (50 ms – 3 s) to unpair; the screen confirms success. Wait for the 5-second timeout or tap to go back.

> **Note**
>
> If the **Claire** has been paired to some other home already, do not forget to **Unpair** it, as it can prevent new pairing.

#### CO₂ sensor calibration

Navigate to **CO₂ sensor calibration** and hold (1 s). Place the device in fresh air (~400 ppm CO₂) and wait 60 seconds. When prompted to start calibration, tap (50 ms – 3 s) to confirm (3-minute timeout reverts back). Wait while the calibration completes; the system reboots automatically.

#### Display settings

Navigate to **Display settings** and hold (1 s) to access screen preferences:

- **Display anti-burn in** – Select **Display anti-burn in** (hold 1 s). Tap (50 ms – 1 s) to toggle **Enabled** or **Disabled** (Default = **Disabled**) or (go) Back. Hold (1 s) to save selection. This feature is meant for devices running 24/7 in bright light: every 15 minutes it briefly refreshes the display (a few seconds) to reduce burn-in. In normal use the brightness auto-adjusts and dims at night, so burn-in is unlikely and the feature is off by default.
- **Display brightness** – Select **Display brightness** (hold 1 s). Tap (50 ms – 1 s) to toggle between **Automatic** (adjusts via ambient light sensor) or **Manual** (Default = **Automatic**) or (go) Back. Hold (1 s) to choose the selection. Under **Manual** you can tap (50 ms – 1 s) to toggle between **Set brightness** and **Night mode** (or go Back). Hold (1 s) to select your choice:

  - **Set brightness** – Tap (50 ms – 1 s) to toggle between **2%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%** (or go Back).
  - **Night mode** – Tap (50 ms – 1 s) to toggle **ON** or **OFF** (or go Back). **ON** uses the set brightness but drops to 2% in dark environments; **OFF** keeps the set brightness regardless of darkness.
    Hold (1 s) to confirm selection.
- **Back** – Select **Back** and hold (1 s) to return to the device settings list.

#### Exit Menu

Select **Back** and hold (1 s) to return to the main screen.

## Mounting instruction

1. To mount the device on a wall and supply power via the DC terminal, remove the small cover using a flat-head screwdriver or a utility knife. Ensure correct polarity when connecting the DC power wires. Do not reverse the polarity.
2. Use the supplied mounting template to mark the required drill holes for the wall bracket and, if needed, the cable entry hole.
   - Position 1 – mounting with the security screw (recommended for public installations). Use two screws at the sides for fixation.
   - Position 2 – mounting without the security screw.
3. For concrete or brick surfaces, drill the holes using a 5 mm drill bit.
4. Install the mounting bracket: insert wall plugs, align the bracket, insert the screws, and tighten firmly.
5. Attach the device to the mounting bracket.
6. For public installations, secure the device using the included security screw. Use a TA23 triangle drive bit to tighten the screw.
