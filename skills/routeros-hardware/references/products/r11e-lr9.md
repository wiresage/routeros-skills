- Attach antenna cable to the connector on the module:

When installing outdoors please ensure that the device case is waterproof and is designed for outdoor use. The IP rating scale for this device is IP0.
*Mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person.*

## Configuration for RouterOS

To set the configuration for LR please connect to the device and log in with your web browser, WinBox or mobile application. Two easy steps to follow:
**First step:**

- Once logged in, Quick Set will be selected, please switch to WebFig on the right side of the screen. If the configuration is done through mobile application then click on the gear symbol on the right side of the screen to open up an advanced menu.
- On the left side menu please find and select the ion "Lora".
- On the newly opened window select the ers tab.
- Click + to add a w server configuration.
- A new window will appear and you will have to enter:
  Name: (Server name)
  Address: (Server address)
  Up port: (Usually it's 1700)
  Down port: (Usually it's 1700)
- Click OK to save.
  **Second step:**
- Select the Device tab on the previous window.
- Double-click or tap on the line to configure.
- Choose the previously entered network on the drop-down menu.
- Click on the button Enable to enable the gateway.
- Click OK to save.
- The configuration is done.

## Specifications

The module can be installed on the miniPCIe to USB adapter and used in any of our devices with a USB slot and installed Lora package.

**To use it in other devices, packet forwarder from Semtech is required:** [packet_forwarder](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder)

To avoid pollution of the environment, please separate the device from household waste and dispose of it in a safe manner, such as in designated waste disposal sites. Familiarize yourself with the procedures for the proper transportation of the equipment to the designated disposal sites in your area.

## OEM statement

This module is intended for OEM installations only. As such the OEM integrator is responsible for ensuring that the end-user has no manual instructions to remove install or modify the module. This module is limited to installations in mobile or fixed applications. OEM integrators may utilize antennas of like an equal or lesser gain as appearing in the list in this document (reference 47 CFR, paragraph 15.204(c)(4) for further information on this topic. The MikroTik OEM RF Module complies with Part 15 of the FCC rules and regulations.
The Grantee will provide guidance to the Host Manufacturer in ensuring compliance with the Part 15 Subpart B requirements.
OEM Modules have been certified by the FCC for use with other products without any further certification (as per FCC section 2.1091). Separate approval is required for other operating configurations including portable configurations with respect to 47CFR paragraphs 2.1093 and different antenna configurations. The OEM is required to comply with all 47CFR labeling instructions and requirements for the finished products.
Changes or modifications not expressly approved by MikroTik could void the OEM authority to install or operate the equipment. OEMs must test their final product to comply with unintentional radiators (FCC section 15.107 and 15.109) before declaring compliance with their final product to Part 15 of the FCC Rules.
**WARNING:** the OEM must ensure that the FCC labeling requirements are met. This includes a clearly visible label on the outside of the OEM enclosure specifying the appropriate MikroTik OEM RF Module FCC identifier for this product as well as any other required FCC notices as presented below.
This enclosed device complies with 47CFR paragraph 15 C of the FCC rules and regulations. Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) this device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.
Labeling and text information should be of a size of type large enough to be readily legible, consistent with the dimensions of the equipment and the label.
**WARNING:** This device has been tested with a MMCX connector and antennas as listed in the table below. When integrated into the OEM products, these fixed antennas require professional installation. Preventing end users from replacing them with non-compliant antennas.
Antennas of same type and lower gain than those listed above may be used in compliance with certification.

## LE-LAN device restriction

LE-LAN devices are restricted to indoor operation only in the band 5150-5250 MHz. However, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) devices, which are installed in vehicles by vehicles manufacturers, are permitted;
Users should also be advised that high-power radars are allocated as primary users (i.e. priority users) of the bands 5250-5350 MHz and 5650-5850 MHz and that these radars could cause interference and/or damage to LE-LAN devices.
les dispositifs fonctionnant dans la bande de 5 150 ą 5 250 MHz sont réservés uniquement pour une utilisation ą l'intérieur afin de réduire les risques de brouillage préjudiciable aux systčmes de satellites mobiles utilisant les mźmes canaux
Les utilisateurs devraient aussi źtre avisés, d'une part, que les utilisateurs de radars de haute puissance sont désignés utilisateurs principaux (c.-ą-d., qu'ils ont la priorité) des bandes de 5 250 ą 5 350 MHz et de 5 650 ą 5 850 MHz et, d'autre part, que ces radars pourraient causer du brouillage et/ou des dommages aux dispositifs de RL-EL
This radio transmitter (identify the device by certification number or model number if Category II) has been approved by Industry Canada to operate with the antenna types listed below with the maximum permissible gain indicated. Antenna types not included in this list, having a gain greater than the maximum gain indicated for that type, are strictly prohibited for use with this device.
