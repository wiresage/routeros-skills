A valid SIM card must be inserted or an eSIM set up, along with an active Internet connection, for updates to work.

RouterOS provides a wide range of configuration options beyond what's described in this document. We suggest visiting <https://mt.lv/help> explore these features.

For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device for reinstallation, see section .

## Mounting

The IP rating scale for this device is IP67. When mounting outdoors, ensure that any cable openings are directed downwards. You should use POE injector and proper grounding. When using and installing this device pay attention to Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) safety distance with a minimum of 20 cm between the radiator and your body.

The device comes bundled with a metal mounting ring, which can be used on the mounting slot on the backside of the device.

- Use a Phillips screwdriver to loosen the metal ring.
- Slide one end of it through the most convenient of the three mounting slots.
- Position the device on the pole where it will be mounted.
- Slide the loose end of the mounting ring back to its closing latch and use the screwdriver to tighten it.

## Powering

The device accepts **12–28 V DC ⎓** via PoE 802.3af/at. A power supply and PoE injector are included.

**To connect power:**

- Connect the Ethernet cable from the device to the **PoE+DATA** port of the PoE injector.
- Connect your LAN cable to the injector.
- Connect the power supply and plug it into an outlet.

## eSIM settings

By default the device is configured to use the SIM slot. To use the on-board eSIM, switch the slot by using the following command: **`/interface/lte/settings/set sim-slot=esim`**

A single eSIM chip can store multiple eSIM profiles, the maximum profile count depends on the eSIM chip used.

See the [LTE eSIM](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/mobile-networking/lte-5g#lte-esim) page for details.

## Reset button

The reset button has three functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until the green LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration (total 5 seconds).
- Keep holding for 5 more seconds, LED turns solid, release now to turn on CAP mode. The device will now look for a CAPsMAN server (total of 10 seconds).
- Reinstall RouterOS using Netinstall. To reinstall RouterOS using the Netinstall utility, enter the device into BOOTP mode. There are two types of booters available: the regular booter and the backup booter.Regular booter - Power on the device, wait 1-2 seconds, then press and hold the Reset button. Wait until the "USR" LED is blinking, then turns solid "On". When the "USR" LED turns "Off", release the Reset button - the device will enter BOOTP mode.
- Backup booter – Power off the device, press and hold the Reset button, then power it on. Wait until the "USR" LED is blinking, then turns solid "On". When the "USR" LED turns "Off", release the Reset button - the device will enter BOOTP mode using the backup booter.
  Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

NetinstallWhen performing Netinstall, make sure to use the latest v7 version of both ROS files and the Netinstall software.

## Grounding

The device includes a grounding connection (marked ⏚) which you should connect to the grounding installation of the tower or building where the device will be used. This is to substantially reduce the risk of ESD and lightning damage.
