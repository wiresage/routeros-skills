## Powering

The SXTsq-5axD accepts 12-28 V DC ⎓ power from Passive PoE injectors (one power supply and PoE injector are included) consuming at maximum load up to 6 W.

### Connecting to a PoE Adapter

- Connect the Ethernet cable from the device to the PoE+DATA port of the PoE adapter.
- Connect an Ethernet cable from your local network (LAN) to the PoE adapter.
- Connect the power cord to the adapter, and then plug the power cord into a power outlet.

## Extension slots and ports

- One Ethernet 10/100/1000 Mbit, supporting automatic cross/straight cable correction (Auto MDI/X), so you can use either straight or cross-over cables for connecting to other network devices.
- One integrated Wireless module operating at 5 GHz, supporting 802.11a/n/ac/ax protocols, with a 16 dBi antenna gain.

## Reset button

The reset button has three functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration (total 5 seconds).
- Keep holding for 5 more seconds, LED turns solid, release now to turn on CAP mode. The device will now look for a CAPsMAN server (total 10 seconds).
- Or hold this button during boot time until LED light starts flashing, keep holding the button until LED turns off, then release it to make the RouterBOARD look for Netinstall servers (~15-20 seconds).
  Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

## Grounding

The device includes a grounding connection (marked ⏚) which you should connect to the grounding installation of the tower or building where the device will be used. This is to substantially reduce the risk of ESD and lightning damage.

## Accessories

Package includes the following accessories that come with the device:

- EU/US Switching Power Supply 24V DC ⎓, 0.38 A, 9 W
- POE Injector with shielded connector/Gigabit POE injector.
- Hose Clamp SUS304 (Phillips type; clamping diameter range 30-70 mm).
