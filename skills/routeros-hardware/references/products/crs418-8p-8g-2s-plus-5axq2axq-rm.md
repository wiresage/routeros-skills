The Wi-Fi version of CRS418... with our strongest 4x4 MIMO Wi-Fi 6! L3 HW offloading, quad-core 2.2 GHz ARM CPU, 16x Gigabit Ethernet ports + a Gigabit management port with a direct CPU line, 2x 10G SFP+ ports, PoE-out. See the [CRS418-8P-8G-2S+5axQ2axQ-RM product page](https://mikrotik.com/product/crs418_8p_8g_2s_wifi) for full specifications and brochures.

## Quickstart

- Ensure your Internet Service Provider (ISP) allows hardware changes and automatically assigns an IP address;
- Connect the ISP cable to the Ethernet1 port;
- Connect the device to the power source;
- Connect to the device through any of the ports, excluding Ethernet1, or the wireless network "MikroTik-..." (ensure to check the wireless passwords on the sticker);
- Establish a connection using a mobile application. Alternatively, use WebFig in a web browser or the "WinBox" configuration tool at <https://mt.lv/winbox>. **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Start configuration within the chosen tool, using the default IP address 192.168.88.1. If the IP address is unavailable, use WinBox and choose the "Neighbors" tab to find the device;
- Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "admin", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- Click the "Check for updates" button and update RouterOS to the latest version;
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the WebFig or WinBox "Files" menu and reboot the device;
- By upgrading your RouterOS software to the latest version, you can ensure optimal performance, stability, and security updates;
- In the "QuickSet" menu set up the following: Choose your country, to apply country regulation settings;
- Set up your wireless network password in the left field;
- Set up your router password in the bottom field.

## Mounting

The device is designed for indoor use and can be mounted in a rack enclosure using the provided rackmount brackets or placed on a desktop.

If installing the device in a rack, ensure there is enough space for the antennas and that they can be positioned freely without obstruction.For desktop placement, attach the rubber feet to the bottom of the router.

For rack installation, use a Phillips screwdriver to attach the rackmount ears on both sides of the device:

- Attach the rackmount ears and the rear support ears to both sides of the device and tighten the four screws to secure them, as shown in the picture.
  *[Figure]*
- Place the device in the rackmount enclosure and align it with the mounting holes.
- Tighten the screws to secure the device in place.
  The device has no protection from water contamination, please ensure the placement of the device in a dry and ventilated environment.
  We recommend Cat6 cables for our devices.
  Mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person.

## Powering

The unit is equipped with two power supplies, 250 W, which accepts 100-240 V ⏦ (~ 50/60 Hz 4.5 A max).
The maximum power consumption without attachments is 43 W, and under maximum load, it can reach 227 W.

## Configuration

Full documentation for RouterOS is available at: <https://mt.lv/help> You can configure the device using WebFig in a web browser or the "WinBox" configuration tool <https://mt.lv/winbox>. **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility.**
**To start setup, open <https://192.168.88.1> in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use WinBox and choose the "Neighbors" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "admin", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker).
The device is equipped with an RJ45 serial port, set by default to 115200 bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity. For recovery purposes, it is possible to reinstall the device from the network, see the Reset button.

## Buttons

**Reset button**:

- Hold this button during boot time until the USER LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Hold the Reset button and power on your device (wait until the "USER" led is blinking then stable "On", and when the "USER" LED is "Off" - release the Reset button) - the device is booting in BOOTP mode to reinstall RouterOS using Netinstall. **The MGMT/BOOT Ethernet port is used for the Netinstall process.** See RouterOS documentation about using the Netinstall recovery utility.
  Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Release the button before LED begins to flash, to only load backup RouterBOOT without resetting. This is useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
