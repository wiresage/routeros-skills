## Reset button

The reset button has three functions:

- To reset the configuration, unplug the device from power, press and hold the Reset button, plug in power again, and release the button when the PWR LED starts flashing.
- To load the backup bootloader, press and hold the Reset button before applying power, then release it after three seconds.
- To reinstall RouterOS using the [Netinstall](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/tags/netinstall) utility, enter the device into BOOTP mode. Two booter options are available: the **Regular Booter** and the **Backup Booter**. It is recommended to verify both options in case one does not work.
  - **Regular Booter:** To enter etherboot mode, press the **Reset** button after powering on the device and waiting 1–2 seconds.
  - **Backup Booter:** Power off the device. Press and hold the **Reset** button, then power on the device. Wait for the **LED** sequence (blinking → steady → off), then release the button. The device will boot into **BOOTP** mode, ready for RouterOS reinstallation via Netinstall. Depending on the model, this may be indicated by the **USR, USER, System**, or **ACT** LED, or by the SFP port LED.

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
