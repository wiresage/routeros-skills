You wanted a switch that could do more. So we built one that does everything! 16x (+1) Gigabit Ethernet ports (8x with PoE-out), dual 10G uplinks, and a powerful quad-core 2.2 GHz ARM CPU. Powerful enough to replace most small/medium office routers, ~3x faster than a CRS320 or a CRS328… and for a better price! See the [CRS418-8P-8G-2S+RM product page](https://mikrotik.com/product/crs418_8p_8g_2s_rm) for full specifications and brochures.

## Quickstart

- Connect with your PC to any Ethernet port;
- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure the IP settings of your network card to 192.168.88.2/24;
- Use WebFig in a web browser or the "WinBox" configuration tool <https://mt.lv/winbox>. **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open <https://192.168.88.1> in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use WinBox and choose the "Neighbors" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "admin", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the WebFig or WinBox "Files" menu and reboot the device;
- By upgrading your RouterOS software to the latest version, you can ensure optimal performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

## Mounting

The device is designed for indoor use and can be either mounted in a rack enclosure using the provided rackmount brackets or simply placed on a desktop. Please attach rubber pegs on the bottom of the router if the desired placement is on the flat surface or use a Phillips screwdriver to attach rackmount ears on both sides of the device if designated use is for rackmount enclosure:

- Attach rackmount ears and the rear support ears to both sides of the device and tighten four screws to secure them in place, as shown in the picture.
  *[Figure]*
- Place the device in the rackmount enclosure and align with the holes so that the device fits conveniently.
- Tighten screws to secure it in place.
  The device has no protection from water contamination, please ensure the placement of the device in a dry and ventilated environment.
  We recommend Cat6 cables for our devices.
  Mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person.

## Powering

The unit is equipped with two power supplies, 250 W, which accepts 100-240 V ⏦ (~ 50/60 Hz 4.5 A max).
The maximum power consumption without attachments is 28 W, and under maximum load, it can reach 215 W.

## Configuration

Full documentation for RouterOS is available at: <https://mt.lv/help> You can configure the device using WebFig in a web browser or the "WinBox" configuration tool <https://mt.lv/winbox>. **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility.**
**To start setup, open <https://192.168.88.1> in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use WinBox and choose the "Neighbors" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "admin", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker).
The device is equipped with an RJ45 serial port, set by default to 115200 bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity. For recovery purposes, it is possible to reinstall the device from the network, see the Reset button.

## Buttons

**Reset button**:

- Hold this button during boot time until the USER LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Hold the Reset button and power on your device (wait until the "USER" led is blinking then stable "On", and when the "USER" LED is "Off" - release the Reset button) - the device is booting in BOOTP mode to reinstall RouterOS using Netinstall. **The MGMT/BOOT Ethernet port is used for the Netinstall process.** See RouterOS documentation about using the Netinstall recovery utility.
  Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Release the button before LED begins to flash, to only load backup RouterBOOT without resetting. This is useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
