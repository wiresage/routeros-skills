### hAP be lite - A42G-HbeP

The most affordable Wi-Fi 7 router & access point for networks that need the flexibility and the power of RouterOS. USB-C powering, 2.5 Gigabit & Gigabit Ethernet, Wi-Fi 7 Multi-Link Operation, BE3600. See the [hAP be lite product page](https://mikrotik.com/product/hap_be_lite) for full specifications and brochures.

The hAP be lite brings modern Wi-Fi 7 performance and RouterOS flexibility into a compact and affordable platform built for setups where space, style, speed, and budget all matter equally. The compact design, low power consumption (up to 12 W), and USB-C powering make placement simple almost anywhere.

#### Wi-Fi 7 built to deliver more & cost less

Powerful dual-band Wi-Fi 7 antennas and WiFi 7 Multi-Link Operation (MLO) deliver BE3600-class wireless performance for laptops, phones, tablets, and other everyday devices.

Our Wi-Fi 7 products are designed for today’s extremely crowded wireless environments, where more devices than ever are competing for the same airspace. Even in busy areas, Wi-Fi 7 helps keep connections smooth and responsive. The hAP be lite combines dual-chain 2.4 GHz and triple-chain 5 GHz radios, giving additional wireless capacity where modern devices need it most.

On the wired side, we have three Gigabit Ethernet ports and one 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port for high-speed uplinks, workstations, NAS devices, or other demanding situations.

Under the hood, the hAP be lite runs on a modern dual-core ARM CPU at 950 MHz with 512 MB of RAM, delivering reliable performance for advanced networking tasks and heavy traffic.

But hardware is only part of the story. With RouterOS, you get far more than basic wireless connectivity. Build VLANs, configure VPNs, shape traffic, apply advanced firewall rules, automate tasks with scripting, and fully customize your setup to match your exact needs.

No artificial limits. No subscriptions, paywalls or locked features. RouterOS gives you full control, whether you are managing a single compact setup or a much larger network.

You also get access to the updated CAPsMAN for centralized management of multiple MikroTik access points from a single interface.

## Powering

- Number of DC inputs: 1 (USB-C).
- USB C input Voltage: 5 V.
- Max power consumption 12 W.

## Setup

- Ensure your Internet Service Provider (ISP) allows hardware changes and automatically assigns an IP address;
- Connect the ISP cable to the Ethernet1 port;
- Connect the device to the power source;
- Connect to the device through any of the ports, excluding Ethernet1, or the wireless network "MikroTik-..." (ensure to check the wireless passwords on the sticker);
- Establish a connection using a mobile application. Alternatively, use WebFig in a web browser or the "WinBox" configuration tool at <https://mt.lv/winbox>. **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Start configuration within the chosen tool, using the default IP address 192.168.88.1. If the IP address is unavailable, use WinBox and choose the "Neighbors" tab to find the device;
- Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "admin", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- Click the "Check for updates" button and update RouterOS to the latest version;
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the WebFig or WinBox "Files" menu and reboot the device;
- By upgrading your RouterOS software to the latest version, you can ensure optimal performance, stability, and security updates;
- In the "QuickSet" menu set up the following: Choose your country, to apply country regulation settings;
- Set up your wireless network password in the left field;
- Set up your router password in the bottom field.

## Configuration

Full RouterOS documentation is located here: <https://mt.lv/help> The device comes pre‑configured as a router: the WAN port (Ethernet1) is protected by a firewall and runs DHCP, while all other Ethernet ports and the wireless interface are part of the LAN bridge.
To set up the device, connect the ISP cable to the Ethernet1 port and plug the unit into a power source. Then access the device using any Ethernet port except Ethernet1, or join the default Wi‑Fi network named “MikroTik‑…”. The Wi‑Fi password is printed on the sticker attached to the device.
You can connect via the mobile app, WebFig in a web browser, or the WinBox tool (download from <https://mt.lv/winbox>). Configuration with the default IP address 192.168.88.1; if that address is unreachable, open WinBox, go to the “Neighbors” tab, and discover the device.
For recovery, the firmware can be reinstalled over the network using the Reset button.

## Buttons and jumpers

The reset button has three functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until the green LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Keep holding the reset button until the LED turns solid, then release it to enable CAP mode. The device will then start searching for a CAPsMAN server.
- To reinstall RouterOS using the [Netinstall](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/tags/netinstall) utility, enter the device into BOOTP mode. Two booter options are available: the **Regular Booter** and the **Backup Booter**. It is recommended to verify both options in case one does not work.
  - **Regular Booter:** To enter etherboot mode, press the **Reset** button after powering on the device and waiting 1–2 seconds.
  - **Backup Booter:** Power off the device. Press and hold the **Reset** button, then power on the device. Wait for the **LED** sequence (blinking → steady → off), then release the button. The device will boot into **BOOTP** mode, ready for RouterOS reinstallation via Netinstall. Depending on the model, this may be indicated by the **USR, USER, System**, or **ACT** LED, or by the SFP port LED.

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

## Operating System Support

The device supports RouterOS v7 and above. The specific factory-installed version is listed in **`/system resource`**. Other operating systems have not been tested.
