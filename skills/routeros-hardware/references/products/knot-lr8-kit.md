## Modbus

KNOT's Modbus configuration guide.

## Bluetooth antenna

By default, the KNOT has a built-in internal antenna that can be used but it is also possible to connect an external antenna instead to increase Bluetooth operation range. This is relevant for the KNOT RB924i-2nD-BT5&BG77 devices.

For the KNOT LR8 kit, KNOT LR8G kit, KNOT LR9 kit and KNOT LR9G kit, Bluetooth external antenna pigtail placeholder is **not available** (there is already an SMA slot in place that is used by the LoRa).

To use an external antenna, you will need a U.FL (female) to SMA connector (pigtail) and a Bluetooth antenna (that can be attached to the SMA).

*[Figure]*

- Unscrew the screw between two SMA slots for CAT-M/NB and GNSS and remove the case.
- Connect U.FL (female) pigtail to the BT slot on the board (as shown in the picture above).
- Drill the hole in the board's case in the specific spot (circular outline from the inside of the case) as per the picture, and attach SMA to the case (where the hole was drilled).
- Connect Bluetooth antenna to the SMA slot.
  You will need to change the antenna that you wish to use (newly connected "external" or the build-in "internal") in the RouterOS settings (under IoT→ Bluetooth→Devices→double-click on the Bluetooth interface→ in the `Antenna` field):

*[Figure]*

U.FL to SMA pigtail and the external Bluetooth antenna are not provided with the package.

## GPS and NB/CAT-M

Attach your antennas to the SMA connectors:

*[Figure]*

BG77 supports NB and GNSS. For the KNOT, KNOT LR8 and KNOT LR9 kit, both (NB+GNSS) cannot be used together simultaneously.

An example of the configuration to automate the switch between the cellular and GNSS priority is shown below under the **Cellular and GNSS priority switch automation** section. Please also check the [WWAN and GNSS priority automatization](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/mobile-networking/bg77-modem-at-commands/wwan-and-gnss-priority-automatization) guide.

External antennas must be connected to use the Narrow Band modem and GPS. Not provided with the package.

A port named "modem" is used for cellular connection (serial/PPP connection) and GNSS NMEA data:

```ros
/port printFlags: I - INACTIVEColumns: DEVICE, NAME, CHANNELS, USED-BY, BAUD-RATE#   DEVICE  NAME    CHANNELS  USED-BY  BAUD-RATE0           modbus         1                96001   1-1.4   modem          5              115200
```

Default modem port channel assignment:

1 - GNSS NMEA output port;

2 - AT/modem port;

4 - AUX AT/modem port - max bandwidth 115200bps, available only for KNOT LoRa kits and KNOT with an internal USB hub.

### Cellular modem configuration

Unlike LTE devices, the KNOT BG77 by default does not provide a direct IP modem interface (LTE interface), but provides AT/modem serial port which is used for serial/PPP connection.

BG77 modem AT commands can be found in the [BG77 AT Commands Manual](https://mikrotik.com/product/knot#tab0).

KNOT by default has a serial/PPP connection preset:

```ros
/interface ppp-client printFlags: X - disabled; R - running 0 R  name="ppp-out1" max-mtu=1500 max-mru=1500 mrru=disabled port=modem data-channel=2 info-channel=4 apn="internet"      pin="" user="" password="" profile=default phone="" dial-command="ATDT" modem-init="AT+QGPSCFG="priority",1"      null-modem=no dial-on-demand=yes add-default-route=yes default-route-distance=1 use-peer-dns=yes keepalive-timeout=30      allow=pap,chap,mschap1,mschap2
```

For more details on modem port configuration please see the KNOT port configuration/map above.

For more details on serial/PPP connection please check the [PPP Client](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/mobile-networking/ppp) documentation.

### GNSS configuration

You can find more information by checking the [GNSS configuration](#gnss-configuration) guide.

BG77 modem shares the same receiver for IoT cellular connectivity and GNSS signal reception. The preferred service can be prioritized by using the **modem-init** string (configured under `/interface ppp-client`) and GNSS service **init-string** (configured under `/system gps`).

AT commands are:

AT+QGPSCFG="priority",0 → to prioritize GNSS;
AT+QGPSCFG="priority",1 → to prioritize cellular IoT connectivity;

AT+QGPSEND → to stop GNSS reception;
AT+QGPS=1 → to start GNSS reception.

Additionally, you can configure Supported GNSS Constellations with the help of the AT command:

AT+QGPSCFG="gnssconfig"[,<GNSS_config>]

,which takes effect only after the module is rebooted and where <GNSS_config> represents the Constellations themselves (can be "1" to "5"):

- 1 → GPS + GLONASS
- 2 → GPS + BeiDou
- 3 → GPS + Galileo
- 4 → GPS + QZSS
- 5 → Variable - one of the options (1–4) is selected based on MCC of the camped network

### Cellular modem firmware upgrade

Please note that:

- DFOTA firmware check/upgrade can be done using any internet connection (including wi-fi and ethernet uplinks). As a result, the modem firmware can be upgraded for devices where BG77 does not have cellular connectivity, eg when its used as a GPS receiver only.
- Firmware upgrade is supported when BG77 modem serial/PPP interface is using the main AT/modem channel (data-channel=2).
  To check currently installed BG77 firmware version, specify "upgrade=no" parameter using the command:

```ros
/interface/ppp-client/firmware-upgrade ppp-out1 upgrade=no  installed: BG77LAR02A04_01.001.01.001     latest: BG77LAR02A04_01.009.01.009
```

To update BG77 modem firmware, set the parameter "upgrade=yes":

```ros
/interface/ppp-client/firmware-upgrade ppp-out1 upgrade=yes
```

### Cellular and GNSS priority switch automation

Automation can be achieved using ppp profile **on-down** script, **idle-timeout** features and PPP interface **dial on demand** setting.

When implemented, BG77 modem will use cellular data when there is internet traffic present (during this time GNSS coordinates are not received), and will automatically enable GPS reception when there is no internet traffic detected.

**Idle-timeout** parameter specifies the amount of time after which the link will be terminated if there is no activity present.

**On-down** script field allows you to configure a script that will be run every time the PPP interface goes down (including after **idle-timeout** inactivity). The script will set modem's priority to GNSS reception.

**Dial-on-demand** will make sure that PPP interface tries to establish the connection only when there is outgoing traffic present (additionally, the modem will automatically set WWAN/cellular connection priority). This will make sure that after **idle-timeout** occurs, the connection is not automatically reestablished unless outgoing packets are detected.

By combining the three features, you can achieve the scenario, where:

- If you have outgoing traffic, PPP interface is going to be up (because of the **dial on demand**) and the priority will be set to the cellular connection. PPP interface's modem initialization AT command (that is configured under PPP interface's `modem-init="AT+QGPSCFG=\"priority\",1"` setting) for WWAN priority is sent. During this time, GPS coordinates will not be received.
- If no traffic is detected after **idle-timeout** inactivity window, the PPP interface will go down and, because of the **dial on demand** setting, it will not establish the connection until outgoing packets are detected. This is where **on-down** script is run that switches WWAN priority to GNSS priority.
  In order to implement it, simply add a new PPP profile:

```ros
/ppp profile add idle-timeout=30s name=BG77 on-down="/interface ppp-client at-chat [find where modem-init=\"AT+QGPSCFG=\\\"priority\\\",1\"] input=\"AT+QGPSCFG=\\\"priority\\\",0\""
```

The example above, creates a new profile with the name "BG77", sets **idle-timeout** to 30 seconds, and enables the **on-down** script that will send GNSS priority AT command.

After that, make sure to apply this newly created profile onto the PPP interface:

```ros
/interface ppp-client set [find] profile=BG77
```

And confirm that it was applied (`profile=BG77`):

```ros
/interface ppp-client printFlags: X - disabled; R - running0 R name="ppp-out1" max-mtu=1500 max-mru=1500 mrru=disabled port=modem data-channel=2 info-channel=2apn="internet" pin="" user="" password="" profile=BG77 phone="" dial-command="ATDT" modem-init="AT+QGPSCFG="priority",1" null-modem=no dial-on-demand=yes add-default-route=yesdefault-route-distance=1 use-peer-dns=yes keepalive-timeout=30 allow=pap,chap,mschap1,mschap2
```

## Buttons and jumpers

The reset button has three functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until the green LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Keep holding the reset button until the LED turns solid, then release it to enable CAP mode. The device will then start searching for a CAPsMAN server.
- To reinstall RouterOS using the [Netinstall](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/netinstall) utility, enter the device into BOOTP mode. Two booter options are available: the **Regular Booter** and the **Backup Booter**. It is recommended to verify both options in case one does not work.
  - **Regular Booter:** To enter etherboot mode, press the **Reset** button after powering on the device and waiting 1–2 seconds.
  - **Backup Booter:** Power off the device. Press and hold the **Reset** button, then power on the device. Wait for the **LED** sequence (blinking → steady → off), then release the button. The device will boot into **BOOTP** mode, ready for RouterOS reinstallation via Netinstall. Depending on the model, this may be indicated by the **USR, USER, System**, or **ACT** LED, or by the SFP port LED.

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

## GPIO pinout

GPIO pins are located on the board under the case as shown in the picture:

*[Figure]*

ADC input/analog input (pin2 or pin3):

*[Figure]*

**Note:** *Analog input voltage is 0-60 V. Theoretical resolution is 4 mV (14bit ADC). Analog input impedance is approximately 72K Ohm.*

Connected relays (pin4 or pin6):

*[Figure]*

*note: The maximum power dissipation (for digital output open drain transistor) is 0.48 W.It is recommended not to exceed 24V or 0.5A during continuous operation. Absolute maximum drain-source voltage is 30V , and the maximum amperage is 2.8A .*

*[Figure]*

*GPIO output has an open drain configuration. **Logical state "0"** (open transistor state) sets the output transistor in a low resistance state and the output is ~0V. **Logical state "1"** (closed transistor state) sets the output transistor in a high resistance state and the output voltage depends on the external circuit.*

Tamper switch (pin5):

*[Figure]*

**Note:** *Digital input voltage is 0-2.5 V max.*

*Without PCB pull-up resistor:*

- *to receive a logical "0" on the pin, the voltage should be between 0-1.47 V;*
- *to receive a logical "1" on the pin, the voltage should be between 1.48-2.5 V.*
  *With PCB pull-up resistor:*
- *to receive a logical "0" on the pin, the voltage should be between 0-1.34 V;*
- *to receive a logical "1" on the pin, the voltage should be between 1.35-2.5 V.*
  *Newer routerboards will have a pull-up resistor on the PCB (on the board) - 10k ohm. Older boards (the first released batch) may need an external pull-up resistor.*

## Accessories

The package includes the following accessories that come with the device:

- ADAPT1_ EU/US Switching Power Supply 24V, 1.2A, 28.8W, 86.8%, VI.

## Operating system support

The device supports RouterOS v7 and above. The specific factory-installed version is listed in `/system resource`. Other operating systems have not been tested.

## Configuration

RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting here to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: <https://mt.lv/help>. In case an IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool (<https://mt.lv/winbox>) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the internet port by default).
For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from the network, see [Netinstall](https://manual.mikrotik.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/netinstall) documentation.

**Note:** Make sure that the **iot** package is installed beforehand.

## Overview

Protocols such as MQTT and HTTP are widely used to push data within M2M networks. M2M topologies can use different technologies, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to send data within networks.

KNOT is a new addition to one of our IoT solutions. KNOT acts as an IoT gateway (that uses Narrow Band and CAT-M technology) and uses Bluetooth to scan broadcasted information. With the Bluetooth interface, you can use the KNOT for asset tracking and telemetry based on Bluetooth advertisement packets. KNOT supports any BLE tag that sends advertisement data. iBeacon, Eddystone, or any other format. It has powerful filters for forwarding only relevant packets and ignoring others. After the gateway processes the data that it receives, it can use an ISP connection to publish the data further to any subscriber or server that is configured accordingly.

All you need to do is to configure a script. The script can filter broadcasted information and push it to the internet.

This article explains how to configure KNOT to publish data using MQTT or http protocols.

External antennas must be connected to use the Narrow Band modem and GPS. Not provided with the package.

## Reports

Navigate to `IoT` > `Bluetooth`.

You can find all broadcasting devices in the `Advertising reports` tab.

*[Figure]*

In this menu, you can set up a filter by pressing the `Filter` icon. For example, knowing the MAC address of the device, you can set up a filter to only show specific reports.

*[Figure]*

You can add more filter options using `+` icon.

You can remove filter options using `-` icon.

## MQTT Broker configuration

Navigate to `IoT` > `MQTT`.

You can add a new broker via `+` button.

*[Figure]*

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Identification. Brokers name. |
| Address | IP address or FQDN name of the MQTT broker without ssl:// or tcp:// prefix. |
| Port | Network port of the broker. Usually, 1883 or 8883 (for SSL). |
| SSL | Enable/Disable Secure Socket Layer. If the server uses a self-signed certificate or certificate signed by a non-trusted CA, you have to upload the server's certificates <crt> file to RouterOS. Upload .cer file to the `Files` menu and import the file to certificates in the System>Certificates tab. |
| Username | Username for MQTT broker. |
| Password | Password for MQTT broker. |
| Client Id | A unique ID used for the connection. The broker uses this ID to identify the client. |
| Certificate | Chose a certificate if required for the two-way authentication. |

**Note:** You do not have to specify servers certificate (.cer file) in the MQTT broker settings. The `Certificate` field is used for the client's certificate.

**Note:** `Name`, `Address`, and `Port` field configuration is required. Other parameters can be optional or required - depends on how the server/broker is set up.

## Publish

After you create a broker, click the `Publish` button. This box allows you to choose a broker and specify message information.

*[Figure]*

Select an already configured broker in the `Broker` field (scroll-down menu).

You can then specify the `Topic` (a string used by a broker to filter messages), `Message` (the message itself), `QoS` (indicates Quality of Service level for the message), and `Retain` (whether to retain the message or discard it) parameters.

**Note:** `Broker` and `Topic` field configuration is required. `Message`, `QoS`, and `Retain` can be optional or required - depends on how the server/broker is set up.

## MQTT with script scenario

MQTT broker can be configured with scripts.

Create a new script, use the template as a reference, change the parameters accordingly and run the script.

Every line that begins with a symbol "**#**" is instructional and it describes the parameter that is going to be configured below the line. Change the parameters within quotation marks "" that would apply to your specific case.

Script example:

```ros

```

To run this script, the Broker should be pre-configured:

*[Figure]*

For example, thingsboard only requires settings that are shown in the screenshot above. When you successfully configure the broker, the only thing that needs to be changed in the script is:

```ros
:local broker "Demo Device"
```

line, where you should specify the broker's name within the quotation marks "".

Another line that should be taken into account is:

```ros
:local topic "v1/devices/me/telemetry"
```

, where you should specify the topic.

The rest of the script configuration depends on the overall requirements. The script explains which exact parameters are configured to be published.

Navigate to `System` > `Scripts` and add a new script there (name it, for example, script1).

To run the script, you can use the command line:

`/system script run script1`

## HTTP fetch with script scenario

Another way to publish data is to use HTTP (instead of MQTT). This can be achieved using fetch tool.

The same principles apply:

Create a new script, use the template as a reference, change the parameters accordingly and run the script.

Every line that begins with a symbol "**#**" is instructional and it describes the parameter that is going to be configured below the line. Change the parameters within quotation marks "" that would apply to your specific case.

Script example:

```ros

Change the URL accordingly (depends on the server configuration).

```ros
/tool fetch http-method=post http-header-field="Content-Type:application/json" http-data=$message url="https://demo.thingsboard.io/api/v1/Q99YlBqv59NdzOel6tyP/telemetry"
```

Navigate to `System` > `Scripts` and add a new script there (name it, for example, script1).

To run the script, you can use the command line:

`/system script run script1`
