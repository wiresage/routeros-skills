The maximum power consumption without attachments is 92 W, and under maximum load, it can reach 123W.

## Configuration

Full documentation for RouterOS is available at: <https://mt.lv/help> You can configure the device using WebFig in a web browser or the "WinBox" configuration tool <https://mt.lv/winbox>. **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility.**
**To start setup, open <https://192.168.88.1> in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use WinBox and choose the "Neighbors" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "admin", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker).

## Cooling

The device is equipped with two New MT-HotSwapFan-V2 units.

## Buttons

**Reset button**:

- Hold this button during boot time until the USR LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Hold the Reset button and power on your device (wait until the "USR" led is blinking then stable "On", and when the "USR" led is "Off" - release the Reset button) - the device is booting in bootp mode to reinstall RouterOS using Netinstall. **The MGMT/BOOT Ethernet port (Ether1 or Ether2) is used for the Netinstall process.** See RouterOS documentation about using the Netinstall recovery utility.
  Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Release the button before LED begins to flash, to only load backup RouterBOOT without resetting. This is useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
