## Quickstart

- Connect with your PC to any Ethernet port;
- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure the IP settings of your network card to 192.168.88.2/24;
- Use WebFig in a web browser or the "WinBox" configuration tool <https://mt.lv/winbox>. **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open <https://192.168.88.1> in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use WinBox and choose the "Neighbors" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "admin", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the WebFig or WinBox "Files" menu and reboot the device;
- By upgrading your RouterOS software to the latest version, you can ensure optimal performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.
  The device should be used in optical fiber applications where cables can be pulled through the cable glands and then connected to the QSFP modules. It also supports DAC, AOC, and Breakout cables with no-separable connectors, however, the use of them in some ports is possible only with the removed cable glands. Note that using this device without a cable gland will reduce its IP code from IP66 to IP54.
