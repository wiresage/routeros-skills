## Quickstart

- Connect your PC to the ETH/BOOT labeled port or the first Ethernet port;
- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure the IP settings of your network card to 192.168.88.2/24;
- Configuration should be made using **WebFig** in a web browser or the **WinBox** configuration tool <https://mt.lv/winbox>. **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open <https://192.168.88.1> in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the **WebFig** or **WinBox** "**Files**" menu and reboot the device;
- By upgrading your RouterOS software to the latest version, you can ensure optimal performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

## Powering

The device accepts powering from two redundant power supplies, each accepts 100-240 V AC power. You can use either, or both at the same time. Up to 60 W power consumption.

## Extension slots and ports

- 13x 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports.
- 4x 10G SFP+ ports.
- One M.2 slot, type PCIe x4.
- RJ45 console port.
  The CCR2116-12G-4S+ has PCIe Gen 3.0 x4 connection to the M.2 slot.
  Recommended are NVMe M.2 2280mm M key SSD disks with no capacity limitations.

## Mounting

The device is designed to use indoors and it can be mounted in a rackmount enclosure using provided rack mounts, or it can be placed on the desktop. Use a Phillips screwdriver to attach rackmount ears on both sides of the device if designated use is for rackmount enclosure:

*[Figure]*

- Attach rack ears to both sides of the device and tighten four screws to secure them in place, as shown in the picture.
- Place the device in a rackmount enclosure and align with the holes so that the device fits conveniently.
- Tighten screws to secure it in place.
  *The device has no protection from water contamination, please ensure the placement of the device in a dry and ventilated environment.* *We recommend shielded Cat5/6 cables for our devices.* *The mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person.*

## Configuration

Full documentation for RouterOS is available at: <https://mt.lv/help> You can configure the device using **WebFig** in a web browser or the "**WinBox**" configuration tool <https://mt.lv/winbox>. **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility.**
To start setup, open <https://192.168.88.1> in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker).
The device is equipped with an RS-232 serial port, set by default to 115200 bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity. For recovery purposes, it is possible to reinstall the device from the network, see the [Reset button](#buttons-and-jumpers).

## Buttons and jumpers

**Reset button**:

- Hold this button during boot time until the USER LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Hold the Reset button and power on your device (wait until the "USER" led is blinking then stable "On", and when the "USER" LED is "Off" - release the Reset button) - the device is booting in BOOTP mode to reinstall RouterOS using Netinstall. **The MGMT/BOOT Ethernet port is used for the Netinstall process.** See RouterOS documentation about using the Netinstall recovery utility.
  Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Release the button before LED begins to flash, to only load backup RouterBOOT without resetting. This is useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

The Mode button is not functional by default but can be assigned any script in the menu /system routerboard mode-button

## LEDs

The device has four LED lights. PWR1/2 indicates which power supply is being used. FAULT indicates a problem with the cooling fans. USER can be configured in software.

## Accessories

- PLUG1, PLUG2_EU/US power cord, D03+QT3 H05VV-F 3x0.75mm2 1.83m RoHS
- CASE3, CASE4_ 1U rackmount bracket white
- SET1_Fastening set K-57r1v1

## Operating system support

The device supports RouterOS v7 and above. The specific factory-installed version is listed in `/system resource`. Other operating systems have not been tested.
