## Reset button

To use the reset button, hold it and then turn on the device, while still holding the button.

- Release the button when the green LED starts flashing, to reset the RouterOS configuration. To not load the backup bootloader, you can start holding the button after power is already applied.
- Release the button after LED is no longer flashing (~20 seconds) to cause the device to look for Netinstall servers (required for reinstalling RouterOS over the network). You can also release the button at the time when the device has appeared in the Netinstall utility device list.
  Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
