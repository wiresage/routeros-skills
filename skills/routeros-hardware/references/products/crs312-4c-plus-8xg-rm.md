## Combo interface

The four combo interfaces each have two physical connectors of which the only one can be used at the same time. The ports will be automatically represented as combo 1-4 in RouterOS. It is possible to select which physical port will be used in the RouterOS software ethernet menu. If left to default "auto", and both F/T have cables plugged in, SFP will take priority. For example, if you have plugged an Ethernet cable into the 1T port and an SFP module in the 1F port, you will have to choose in RouterOS which one to use. Double click the respective combo interface in RouterOS GUI to see which socket is used.

## Reset button

- To reset the configuration, unplug the device from power, press and hold the Reset button, and release it when the USER (USR) LED starts flashing.
- To load the backup bootloader, press and hold the Reset button before applying power, then release it after three seconds.
- To initiate the Netinstall process (booting the device in BOOTP mode to reinstall RouterOS), press and hold the Reset button, power on the device, and wait for the USER (USR) LED to flash, then become stable. When the USR LED turns off, release the Reset button.
  Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
