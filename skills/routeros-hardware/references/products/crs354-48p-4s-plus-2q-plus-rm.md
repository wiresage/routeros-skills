See the [CRS354-48P-4S+2Q+RM product page](https://mikrotik.com/product/crs354_48p_4s_2q_rm) for full specifications and brochures.

## Quickstart

The device has all interfaces switched.

- Connect with your PC to any Ethernet port;
- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure the IP settings of your network card to 192.168.88.2/24;
- Use WebFig in a web browser or the "WinBox" configuration tool <https://mt.lv/winbox>. **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open <https://192.168.88.1> in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use WinBox and choose the "Neighbors" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "admin", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the WebFig or WinBox "Files" menu and reboot the device;
- By upgrading your RouterOS software to the latest version, you can ensure optimal performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

Output per port (26V out) 1000 mA
Total output power 700 W
Total output 27 A at 26 V, or 13,2 A at 53 V.

## Configuration

Full documentation for both RouterOS and SwOS is available at: <https://mt.lv/help> You can configure the device using WebFig in a web browser or the "WinBox" configuration tool <https://mt.lv/winbox>. **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility.**
**To start setup, open <https://192.168.88.1> in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use WinBox and choose the "Neighbors" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "admin", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker).
The device is equipped with an RJ45 serial port, set by default to 115200 bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity. For recovery purposes, it is possible to reinstall the device from the network, see the Reset button.

The device supports booting either RouterOS (for full routing and switching functionality) or SwOS (for switch-only operation). By default, the device boots into RouterOS, but you can switch to the other operating system as follows:

- From SwOS: Go to the System menu and click the Boot RouterOS button at the bottom of the page.
- From RouterOS: Open System → RouterBOARD → Settings and select Boot OS.
  It is also possible to choose the operating system and configure other boot options using the serial console menu.

## Reset button

The RouterBOOT reset button has the following functions. Press the button and apply the power, then:

- Hold this button during boot time until the USR LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Hold the Reset button and power on your device (wait until the "USR" led is blinking then stable "On", and when the "USR" led is "Off" - release the Reset button) - the device is booting in bootp mode to reinstall RouterOS using Netinstall.**The MGMT Ethernet port is used for the Netinstall process.** See RouterOS documentation about using the Netinstall recovery utility.
  Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Release the button before LED begins to flash, to only load backup RouterBOOT without resetting. This is useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
