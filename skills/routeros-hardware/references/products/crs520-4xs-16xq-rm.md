The device supports booting either RouterOS (for full routing and switching functionality) or SwOS (for switch-only operation). By default, the device boots into RouterOS, but you can switch to the other operating system as follows:

- From SwOS: Go to the System menu and click the Boot RouterOS button at the bottom of the page.
- From RouterOS: Open System → RouterBOARD → Settings and select Boot OS.
  It is also possible to choose the operating system and configure other boot options using the serial console menu.

## Cooling

The device is equipped with four MT-HotSwapFan units.

## Buttons

**Reset button**:

- Hold this button during boot time until the USR LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Hold the Reset button and power on your device (wait until the "USR" led is blinking then stable "On", and when the "USR" led is "Off" - release the Reset button) - the device is booting in bootp mode to reinstall RouterOS using Netinstall. **The MGMT/BOOT Ethernet port is used for the Netinstall process.** See RouterOS documentation about using the Netinstall recovery utility.
  Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Release the button before LED begins to flash, to only load backup RouterBOOT without resetting. This is useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

- Four 25G SFP28 ports.
- Two 1G/10G Ethernet ports for management access.
