Type: Settings Directory

MAC Telnet server settings. The MAC server lets devices on the same layer-2 segment reach the router by its MAC address, without IP configuration: MAC Telnet (this menu), MAC WinBox ([`/tool/mac-server/mac-winbox`](mac-server/mac-winbox.md)) and MAC ping ([`/tool/mac-server/ping`](mac-server/ping.md)). Open MAC Telnet sessions are listed in [`/tool/mac-server/sessions`](mac-server/sessions.md). The IP firewall does not stop MAC access; limit it with `allowed-interface-list`. For examples, see [MAC server](../../guides/management-tools/mac-server.md).

**Arguments**

- `allowed-interface-list` (enum): Interface list on which the router accepts MAC Telnet connections. A bridge in the list also allows connections that arrive through its ports; a bridge port alone in the list does not. `none`, or a list without members, turns MAC Telnet off. A change applies to the next connection at once; open sessions stay. The default configuration sets `LAN`. Default: all.
